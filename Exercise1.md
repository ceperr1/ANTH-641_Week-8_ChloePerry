In Exercise 1, we viewed DartPoint data. We were meant to download a package titled "RcmdrMisc." 
However, I attempted to download this on two different computers and different wifi, but I could never get it to work.
Unfortunately, I could not do #4 within this exercise. I'm unable to summarize the information from this part as a result.
